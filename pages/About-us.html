                    <p>
                        Founded on the principles of sharing, we are a non-profit educational community dedicated to helping students overcome the financial and academic barriers to study abroad. In partnership with our member institutions, we are ale to connect students to high-quality, academic programs at more than 100 universities in 4 countries. Regardless of the academic major, socio-economic status or the geographic location, we believe that no one should be held back from being able to study abroad. Since our foundation, we have sent over 500 students abroad.

                    <p>
                        Through short-term visits to the chosen country, more than 400 international visitors have engaged with locals through our program. The majority of the exchanges include visits to four different communities over 3 weeks. Spending 3-5 days in each city. The goals are to share best practises in a particular focus area, provide participants a chance to connect with locals, and highlight the diversity of countries.
